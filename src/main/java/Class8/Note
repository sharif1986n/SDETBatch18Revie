Arrays:
Its a collection of similar items. The data is stored in consecutive memory location inside the
memory. We use indexing to store and access the data in am array.Every element that we store in
an array is assigned a number these numbers start from 0 first element will be assigned number 0
next one 1 and so on.

Why we Should use arrays:
Its not feasible to use variables for large amounts of data. Storing managing searching large amounts of data
Becomes easier with arrays and loops.
Syntax of Arrays:
We can create arrays in two ways

1) DataType []nameOfArray={item1,item2,item3};
StRING[]NAMES={"Kawoon","Patrick","Halil"}

2)DataType[]nameOfArray=new Datatype[Size];
int[]numbers=new int[5];
