Git has a three stage architecture

Working directory is our current folder where all our
files and folders are which we want to track using GIT.
â Staging area:
Staging area contains the files and folders we want to be in
our next commit
â Local Repository:
Local repository contains all our commits with the message
and unique code assigned to each commit.
Commit takes a snapshot of our code and saves it.
