---------------------------------------------create a new project---------
---------------
we want to track our project using git , so that we are able to create and
save different versions of it!!!
1. location of the project --->the location can be find next to it.
2. navigate our terminal to the location
* open gitbash/terminal and then use the commands like pwd,cd e.t.c
to navigate
OR
* shortcut method :
right click on project folder
openin--->explorer/finder
for windows:
go inside the project folder
and right click and select gitbash here
for mac:
click on the project folder
and right click and click on open terminal at this folder.
3. git init---> it initialzies a empty repository
4.git add .
5. git commit -m "message"
----------------------------------------git follows a 3-stage
architecture--------------------------
1. working directory--->project folder in which all your project files
are located
2. staging area -----> a temporary storage inside the folder .git
3. local repo ------> it is a local repository inside the .git.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------In order to send our codes to github-----------
--------------
1. create a repository on github
* open github.com
* click on new
* enter the repo name --> on the new page
* create repository
2.Establish the connection (One time process)
* git branch -M main --> we will learn later
* git remote add origin "url" ---> connects the repo with the remote
repo
if i want to check that the connection is established
* git remote -v ---> it prints the url of the repository to which you
are connected (make sure it is the correct one)
3.git push -u origin main (the first time u have to use git push -u orign
main)
for every next time
git push --->will work
---------if u connected to a wrong remote repo-----
solution
1, remove the connection --> git remote remove origin
2. git remote -v --> to verify it is deleted
3. to restablish the connection with the new repo
* git branch -M main
* git remote add origin "url" ---> if the url is not seen , u can get
it
* by clicking on the code option, from the drop down u can get the
url (copy it)
4. git remtoe -v to verify
